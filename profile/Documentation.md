# SGX Documentation 

I've noticed that there's a lot written about SGX, but most of the content is a stick-figure
explanation of the technology... which is not helpful for this lab.  This page is reserved
for things folks working in this lab need to know.  It sould contain links, uploaded documentation,
whatever you find helpful.

- [SGX Instructions](https://github.com/Trusted-Execution/.github/blob/main/documentation/SGX%20Instructions.pdf):  Just the chapters relevant to SGX
- [Intel SGX Developers Guide](https://github.com/Trusted-Execution/.github/blob/main/documentation/intel-sgx-developer-guide.pdf):  TBD
- TBD:  Details on how to use `CPUID` to extract information about SGX on your system
