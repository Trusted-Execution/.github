# SGX Documentation 

I've noticed that there's a lot written about SGX, but most of the content is a stick-figure
explanation of the technology... which is not helpful for this lab.  This page is reserved
for things folks working in this lab need to know.  It sould contain links, uploaded documentation,
whatever you find helpful.

- [SGX Instructions](https://github.com/Trusted-Execution/.github/blob/main/documentation/SGX%20Instructions.pdf):  Just the chapters relevant to SGX
- [SDM Model Specific Registers](https://github.com/Trusted-Execution/.github/blob/main/documentation/SDM_Model_Specific_Registers.pdf):  Details on how to use `CPUID` and MSRs (Model Specific Registers) to extract specific information about SGX on your system
- [Linux ABI](https://github.com/Trusted-Execution/.github/blob/main/documentation/Linux_ABI.pdf): The Linux Application Binary Interface

- ELF File Format:
  -- [ELF101 a Linux executable walkthrough](https://github.com/Trusted-Execution/.github/blob/main/documentation/elf101.pdf):  An ELF format poster
  -- [elf(5) man page](https://github.com/Trusted-Execution/.github/blob/main/documentation/elf.pdf):  An 18 page summary of the ELF file format
  -- [ELF Standard](https://github.com/Trusted-Execution/.github/blob/main/documentation/ELF_Format.pdf):  The formal ELF specification
  

## YouTube Videos
[State of Intel SGX in Linux - Jarkko Sakkinen](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeD_eSPFxV0).  It’s a lot to take in, but I learned a few important things from it.
