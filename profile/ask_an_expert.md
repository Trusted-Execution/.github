# Ask an Expert

So many times in my career have I wanted to sit with an expert in subject X and just talk with them. 
That's the hard part about being a senior engineer; oftentimes, the pool of people you can lean on for 
technical issues gets smaller and smaller.  The trick, of course, is to develop a network of experts, 
oftentimes outside of your organization, who you can reach out to.

There are very few people who have deep, hands-on expertise in SGX.  For this project, we will
be digging into more than just SGX, we'll be into compilers, loaders and maybe even the Linux kernel
itself.

This page is intended to be a place where we can document the questions we'd like to ask an expert.
I've found that sometimes, just the act of clearly articulating the question in writing often yields
some insight into the problem.  

Over the course of this project, if we get cornered and we need to reach out and find an expert, then
that's what we will do.  To that end, I'd like a central place where we can document the questions 
we'd like to ask.

## SGX

## Compiler

## Linker

## `glibc` & `ld`

## The Linux ABI

## ELF File Formats
